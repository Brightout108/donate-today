                In contrast to the dramatic nature of the 1998 floods, this year's flooding has been less spectacular, but rather a slow, unfolding disaster which started in July and has been gradually worsening over a two and a half month period.<br>
                 first heavy rains in July affected hilly areas, followed by the inundation of areas not normally considered as flood prone.
                  The force and turbulence of the river water has caused massive erosion, and in the first two weeks of September, 21 new districts have been severely affected from a mixture of water levels and high tides in the Bay of Bengal which have obstructed the natural flow of rivers to the sea. <br>
                  The Federation responded initially to the disaster by providing immediate relief assistance to some particularly vulnerable groups.

                There are always people who, even aside from inflation, when things like this happen, try to take advantage and raise the prices for services and goods. That's always there. But as a humanitarian organization, we only focus at this time on people and what they need. So we pull resources together from different places and try to do a job to save lives.

And also, we got support from good people and organizations, who gave money and other supplies.
